# Chapter 6 Notes

## Why do we need state variables?

## When does the code inside the useEffect Hook execute?

- The code inside the useEffect hook executes right after the body is rendered.

## What happens when state variable changes?

- Whenever the state changes, the reacts triggers a reconciliation cycle, i.e it is re rendering the component
